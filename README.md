# Credit-Card-Check-0.1-C
This is a simple C coded program that checks weather or not a card is valid and what type, 
I made this because it was a homework project online by Harvard. PS. It's just a start if you guys have an 
idea imporvments or wanna make a program just ask I code in Java, C, HTML, CSS, and some Ruby.

It is a C program I have put the code sheet CreditCardCheck also you need the stdio.h
and cs50.h libraries which I have not inculde you can search them up reason being license use and 
stuff side note cs50 is from the Harvard and is used in there CS50 class.
