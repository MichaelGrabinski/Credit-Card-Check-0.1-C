# Credit-Card-Check-0.1-C
This is a simple C coded program that checks weather or not a card is valid and what type, 
I made this because it was a homework project online by Harvard. 

It is a C program I have put the code sheet CreditCardCheck also you need the <stdio.h>
and <cs50.h> libraries which I also have but I did not make those the cs50 is from the Harvard class.
